## Evaluation & Final Examination

- Data Projects (x2)
  - group work
  - goals:
    - import some data
    - perform/replicate some econometric work
    - present results with nice plots
  - handled as a Jupyter Notebook (mixes text and code)
  - subjects proposed by myself and other professors
- Final Exam:
  - on computer
  - test general knowledge of econometrics / machine learning
  - there *will* be some programming tasks

---

## Work Environment

- local programming environment:
  - install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for your computer
  - install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - make sure python extension is activated and configured in VSCode

- online environement:
  - use mybinder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/albop/dbe/HEAD?urlpath=lab)
  - remember: your workspace is __not__ persistent: you need to manually save your work.
