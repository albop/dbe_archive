Plenty of online resources to learn python/econometrics/machine learning

- [learnpython](learnpython.org) sponsored by [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- [quantecon](https://datascience.quantecon.org/): designed for economists, good examples of projects
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): by Jake Van der Plas, very complete. Online free version.
- [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/), in R but very clear
