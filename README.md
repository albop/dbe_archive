## About pushups

* Pushups
    * individual
    * to do after every course, before next session
    * you are *encouraged* to collaborate
    * send via Nuvolos platform

## Evaluation & Final Examination

* Data Projects (x2) (50%)
    * groupwork (goups smaller than 4)
        * import some data
        * perform/replicate some econometric work
        * present results with nice plots
* Final Exam (50%)
    * individual
    * 90 min during last session
    * test general knowledge of econometrics / machine learning
    * there *will* be some programming tasks

### Work Environment

- We will use [Nuvolos](https://nuvolos.cloud/)
  - online datascience platform with Jupyterlab

- You *should* have received an invitation by then.
